# Project: Item Catalog - Shannon Clark

This is a project developed as part of Udacity's [Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/full-stack-web-developer-nanodegree--nd004). The aim of this project is to develop an item catalog web application using the python framework Flask.

## Getting Started
This project is designed to run inside of a virtual machine. To do that, you'll need to install VirtualBox, and Vagrant, before cloning this repository, and running the VM.

### Installing VirtualBox
VirtualBox is the software that actually runs the VM. You can download the version of VirtualBox you need for your operating system from [here](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads). You won't need to run VirtualBox directly.

### Installing Vagrant
Vagrant is a piece of software used to provision, and configure a virtual machine. You can download the version of Vagrant you need for your operating system from [vagrantup.com](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html).
